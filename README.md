# Image-Segmentation-KMeans-Cluster-Machine_learning
This project is about Extraction of Dominant Color for image segmentation by the use of sklearn _KMeans cluster(KMeans++) ,its also include a file named as 'k-means-cluster' where we classify  data by k-means-cluster and  data is generated by sklearn_make_blobs (k-means-cluster algorithm with stratch),
